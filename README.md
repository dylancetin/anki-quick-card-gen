this is a react app with a lot of cool things

basically a local LLM wrapper, lets you configure it to your taste with api keys, hostname etc. (claude, openai and openrouter is supported)

you upload a pdf and start parsing through the pages

LLM generates generic Anki cards like Type-In, Basic and Cloze

You can generate Image-Cloze cards

i use this, if you want to use this u prob need to fork it

When you download the final cards.zip

You need to put the images in [https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations](https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html#file-locations)

Then import the cards.txt to the deck you please
